# Symphony-of-the-Lost

## Project Overview
In the world of Harmonia, music is the essence of life. It is magic, 
weaponry, and the very force that binds existence together. However, one 
fateful night, the note "Sol" vanished from the grand symphony of the 
universe. Silence crept over the land, breaking apart its harmony, and the 
Maestros of Discord awakened. Once great musicians, these entities have 
succumbed to the abyss of nothingness, and now they seek to plunge the 
world into eternal silence. 

You are Melodia, The Last Virtuoso, the sole musician left with the ability to 
wield the sacred power of sound. Your journey will take you through the 
Seven Continents of Music, where you must reclaim the lost note, battle the 
Maestros, and restore the symphony that once sustained the world. 

Game Genre: Action RPG where players use musical notes 
as weapons and musical symbols as buffs/debuffs, incorporating strategic 
combat mechanics to defeat the forces of silence.

## Project Review
